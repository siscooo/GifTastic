# GifTastic

Using use the GIPHY API, I created a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. Click on a category and 10 gifs will populate the site. They do not start playing until you click on the gif. If you click on another category, the gifs will be replaced by the new category. If there are no categories you like, there is an option to add your own category. The category will be added to the rest of the categories and will permanently stay on the page until it is refreshed. 

Have fun!!!
